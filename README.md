# Dylan-s-HackPad

This project is a custom 3×3 macro pad built around the Seeed XIAO RP2040, featuring a diode-protected key matrix, a rotary encoder for dynamic input, and a 128×32 SSD1306 OLED for real-time status display (RN it displays larry the SLUG). The design uses a proper row/column matrix to prevent ghosting and is powered by QMK firmware for full remapping, layers, and encoder support. This is my first time working with KiCad, and I was excited to learn how to use it through this project. It also helped to sharpen my Fusion 360 and coding skills, and that's why I made this project. SORRY FOR THE LAST SUBMIT. I ACCIDENTALLY UPLOADED MY OLD SCHEMATIC. H
 ALL FILES ARE ON THE MAIN BRANCH. You can find the SCHEMATIC, PCB, and CAD images in the images folder ( I will be adding fully assembled images soon). THANKS FOR VIEWING! I will also be making changes, but this is the first iteration.
